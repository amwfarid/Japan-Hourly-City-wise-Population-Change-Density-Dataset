# Japan-Hourly-City-wise-Population-Change-Density-Dataset (Before & After COVID-19 Emergency Declaration)
# （CSV）緊急事態宣言前後における7都府県の人口変動分析
CSV file representation of population change data originally published as PDF

This repository is an independant effort to convert government published graph data originally in PDF to csv format, to allow utilization by analysis software. The data, [as publicly published by the government of Japan and NTT Docomo](https://corona.go.jp/toppage/pdf/area-transition/20200418_docomo.pdf), addresses population changes before and after the emergency declaration due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Presently, the method used to convert graph images (inside the PDF) to CSV is to take a screenshot and extract the datapoints using the [WebPlotDigitizer online tool](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/). However, this is very labor intensive, so a move towards an automated approach is under development.

The data for Shibuya (渋谷) is made available as CSV.
